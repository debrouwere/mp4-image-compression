MP4 image compression... what nonsense is this? Well, sometimes you have a bunch
of similar images (like screenshots of how a web page changes over time) and 
storing all those images as a video can give some pretty amazing space savings
because video compression algorithms try to always store what has changed 
since the last frame, not the full frame. But of course we don't want a 
video, we want images. Well, we simply seek to the required frame and pause
the video: that's our image right there.

Run `./convert.sh` to see how it works. It will open a web browser with a 
working example and it also calculates the space savings for you.
